                    <span>As a citizen of earth, we have responsibility to save and protect all the living things especially animals. They also need food and shelter just like us.
                       Of 8,300 known animal species, 8% are extinct and 22% are endangered. 
                       These United Nations figures place the planet on the brink of what some scientists now call "the sixth mass extinction."
                       The impact of human action on ecosystems is causing many species to disappear, with irreversible harm to biodiversity and the environment.
                       Therefore, we must always save and protect them by not killing them for any benefit and not randomly destry their hometown.

                                The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a National treasure in China. 
                                Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. 
                                They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. 
                                They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.
                                The reason that they become the endangared animal is the habitat destruction. 
                                They are also lack of bamboo to eat due to the development of some forests or lands.

                             <p class="contentpolarbear">The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. 
                                Considered talented swimmers, polar bears can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a rudder. 
                                They have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that insulates them from the cold air and water.
                                Polar bears rely heavily on sea ice for traveling, hunting, resting, mating and, in some areas, maternal dens. 
                                The reason of polar bear become endangared animal is because the climate changes and causes polar bear loss habitat.
